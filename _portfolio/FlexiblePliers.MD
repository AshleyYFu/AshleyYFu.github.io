# Description of the project with a blurb about print-in-place parts. Perform external research to determine other applications print-in-place has been used. What combination of materials work well for print-in-place?
# EmbeddedCADmodel (DONE)
# About the design (e.g., how was the spring component created and how is it retained in the model, materials used)
# Relevant specifications of the pliers (jaw length, jaw capacity) o Print settings
# Picture gallery of iterations and pliers.
# GIF of pliers working
