# Motivation
  * The motivation behind designing a phone bike mount using top-down modeling is rooted in enhancing the safety, convenience, and overall user experience for cyclists. Cyclists often rely on their smartphones for navigation, tracking fitness data, or staying connected while riding. 
  * A well-designed bike mount ensures that the phone is securely and ergonomically positioned, reducing distractions and the need to handle the device manually. 
  * By adopting a top-down modeling approach, designers can prioritize factors like ease of installation, stability, and adaptability to various phone sizes, guaranteeing a user-centric solution that promotes safer cycling and a more enjoyable riding experience.
