# Motivation
  * The motivation behind designing a phone bike mount using top-down modeling is rooted in enhancing the safety, convenience, and overall user experience for cyclists. Cyclists often rely on their smartphones for navigation, tracking fitness data, or staying connected while riding. 
  * A well-designed bike mount ensures that the phone is securely and ergonomically positioned, reducing distractions and the need to handle the device manually. 
  * By adopting a top-down modeling approach, I was able to prioritize factors like ease of installation, stability, and adaptability to various phone sizes, guaranteeing a user-centric solution that promotes safer cycling and a more enjoyable riding experience.

# Installation
  * This phone mount can be attached to your bike with the use of two [M5-20mm hex screws](https://www.homedepot.com/p/M5-0-8x20mm-Plain-Socket-Cap-Head-Internal-Hex-Drive-Cap-Screw-2-Pieces-D22-S-864838/323371567)
  * Once the mount is attached, apply a moderate amount of force to secure the shaft to the socket.
  * Adjust the fit of your device by rotating the two hex nuts.

# What is top-down modeling?
Top-down modeling is a systematic approach where the entire product or assembly is conceptualized as a whole before diving into the finer details. This method allows designers to establish the overall architecture, define relationships between components, and establish constraints and parameters that govern the entire assembly's behavior.

Key features of top-down modeling in CAD include:

  * Hierarchical Structure: Designers create a hierarchical structure or assembly tree that represents the various components and sub-assemblies of the product. This structure helps organize the design into manageable units.

  * Parametric Relationships: Top-down modeling relies heavily on parametric modeling techniques. Designers define parameters (such as dimensions, angles, and relationships) that control the behavior and appearance of components. This ensures that changes made at the top level cascade down to affect all related components.

  * Global Design Intent: Designers establish the global design intent, which defines the fundamental characteristics and functionality of the product. This intent guides the creation of individual components, ensuring that they align with the overall design vision.

  * Component Interactions: Top-down modeling emphasizes how components interact with each other within the assembly. Designers can define constraints, mates, and relationships between parts, ensuring they fit and function correctly when assembled.

  * Adaptability: Top-down modeling makes it easier to accommodate design changes or variations since modifications made at the top level automatically propagate to subordinate components, reducing the risk of errors and inconsistencies.
