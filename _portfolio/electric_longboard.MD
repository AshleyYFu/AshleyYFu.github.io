# Motivation
Powder bed fusion (PBF) and generative design represent a powerful combination that has revolutionized manufacturing processes, particularly in the aerospace and automotive industries. This unique pairing combines cutting-edge technologies to enhance product design, optimize materials usage, and improve overall efficiency in the production of complex components. This combination offers several advantages, such as:
  * <strong>Lightweight Structures</strong>: Generative design enables the creation of lightweight structures that maintain structural integrity. In aerospace, this can lead to significant fuel savings, while in automotive applications, it contributes to improved fuel efficiency and overall performance.
  * <strong>Material Efficiency</strong>: The iterative nature of generative design allows for the creation of structures that use materials more efficiently. In aerospace, where weight is critical, this translates to reduced fuel consumption and increased payload capacity. In the automotive industry, it contributes to better energy efficiency and reduced environmental impact.
  * <strong>Complex Geometries</strong>: PBF's layer-by-layer construction and generative design's ability to create complex, organic shapes complement each other perfectly. This synergy is particularly beneficial in aerospace, where components often require intricate designs for optimal aerodynamics and structural performance.
  * <strong>Customization</strong>: Aerospace and automotive applications often require components tailored to specific requirements. The PBF-generative design duo allows for the creation of highly customized parts, optimizing performance for each application.
  * <strong>Reduced Waste</strong>: Traditional subtractive manufacturing processes can result in significant material wastage. PBF, in conjunction with generative design, minimizes waste by only using the necessary material to achieve optimal performance.

  # Design
  Fusion 360's Generative Design capabilities were used to iteratively create a longboard truck that could withstand the required forces. The generative design solver was run for both Nylon-12 and ALSi10Mg. 

  To take advantage of Fusion 360's solver, preserve and obstacle geometries were designated. As explained by their names, preserve geometries should be kept by the solver, while obstacle geometries should be avoided.
